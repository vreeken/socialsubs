		"George Lucas was so sure the film would flop that instead of attending the premiere, he went on holiday to Hawaii with his good friend Steven Spielberg, where they came up with the idea for Raiders of the Lost Ark.",
		"The actors found George Lucas to be very uncommunicative towards them, with his only directions generally being either \"faster\" or \"more intense.\" At one point, when he temporarily lost his voice, the crew provided him with a board with just those two phrases written on it.",
		"Prior to the film's release, George Lucas showed an early cut of the film to a group of his film director friends. Most, including Lucas himself, felt the film would be a flop; Brian De Palma reportedly called it the \"worst movie ever.\" The only dissenter was Steven Spielberg, who correctly predicted the film would make millions of dollars."
